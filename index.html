                    <h2>ABOUT ME.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Isaiah. I’m currently enrolled at the University
                        of Wisconsin-Eau Claire with a major in Graphic Design. These past
                        few years I have been practicing and improving my digital design
                        skills in an attempt to better prepare myself in finding a job post
                            graduation. I’ve always loved making art. Typically, my preferred
                            mediums are anything related to sculpting and ceramics.
                            I enjoy being ‘hands-on’ and being able to create something
                            to the best of my abilities. Ever since I was a child I have
                                been creating things. This has overall developed into a passion
                                that has lead me to my career choice. My goal after graduating
                                is to work for a company that I am passionate about
                                and use my creativity effectively in designing  for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I’m neither at work or school, you can often find me outside.
                        I love hiking in places I’ve never been and travelling. Every opportunity
                        I get to experience something new, I take it. I feel like life is
                        soslely made up of a list of opportunities; it’s only a matter
                            of which ones we choose to take. </p>
